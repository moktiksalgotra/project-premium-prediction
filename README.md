# Healthcare Insurance Premium Prediction Using Machine Learning
Leveraging advanced regression techniques to predict premiums with precision and deploying models for real-world applications.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning regression models to predict healthcare insurance premiums. It covers essential stages of real-world workflows, including data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and deployment. By leveraging Python and tools like Streamlit, this project demonstrates how to design, train, and deploy predictive models for real-time decision-making.

# Key Objectives
Develop domain expertise: Understand key factors influencing insurance premium calculations, such as age, BMI, medical history, and lifestyle habits.
Model creation and deployment: Learn the end-to-end process of building machine learning models, from data preprocessing to deployment.
Real-world application: Build a tool using Python and Streamlit for real-time premium prediction, adaptable across industries.

# Key Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1.1 Address missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2.2 Use robust imputation and normalization techniques to prepare the dataset.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.
-Visualize relationships between predictors like BMI, smoking habits, and premium amounts.

3. Feature Engineering

-Create new features such as "Risk Score" and interaction terms for higher predictive accuracy.
-Transform categorical variables using encoding techniques.

4. Regression Modeling

-Train and fine-tune advanced models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
-Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. Error Analysis and Segmentation

-Analyze prediction errors and adjust models to reduce bias.
-Segment customers into risk groups for better premium classification.

6. Deployment

-Deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive, real-time insurance premium prediction.
-Create an intuitive user interface for stakeholders.
